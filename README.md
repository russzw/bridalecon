# BridalEcon 🌍💍

**BridalEcon** is a Next.js-powered web application that explores the economics of weddings around the world. From average venue costs in Tokyo to floral budgets in Paris, BridalEcon aims to visualize and compare wedding expenses across regions using interactive data tools—including a **3D globe** for immersive global insights.

> 💡 **Note**: This project is in early development. The current codebase is a Next.js starter template. Core features—including the 3D globe—are actively being prototyped.

## 🌐 Vision & Features (In Progress)

- **Interactive 3D Globe**:  
  Built with libraries like [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) or [React Globe.gl](https://github.com/vasturiano/react-globe.gl), the globe will display regional wedding cost data as clickable, animated markers or heatmaps.

- **Regional Cost Breakdowns**:  
  Compare average spending on dresses, venues, catering, and more—filtered by country or city.

- **Personalized Budget Planner**:  
  Input your preferences and location to generate a tailored wedding budget.

- **Trend Analysis**:  
  Track how wedding costs have changed over time due to inflation, cultural shifts, or economic conditions.

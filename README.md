# BridalEcon 🌍💍

**BridalEcon** is a data-driven exploration of **bride price** (also known as bride wealth or lobola) practices around the world. This project visualizes the economic, cultural, and regional dimensions of bride price through interactive tools—including a **3D globe** that maps customs, values, and trends across countries and communities.

> 💡 **Note**: This project is in early development. Core features—including the 3D globe and data visualizations—are under active development.

## 🌐 What Is Bride Price?

Bride price is a traditional practice in many societies where the groom or his family provides payment (in cash, livestock, or goods) to the bride’s family as part of formalizing a marriage. It is distinct from dowry and is deeply embedded in social structures, kinship systems, and gender economics.

BridalEcon aims to:
- Document regional variations in bride price customs
- Analyze economic implications (e.g., inflation, commercialization, gender equity)
- Visualize data through an interactive **3D globe**
- Provide historical and anthropological context

## 🗺️ Features

  - Countries where bride price is practiced
  - Average values (adjusted for inflation/local currency)
  - Forms of payment (cattle, cash, land, etc.)
  - Legal status and modern debates
